    "========\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of neural network that excels when your data can be treated as a sequence - such as text, music, speech recognition, connected handwriting, or data over a time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "RNN's can analyse or predict a word based on the previous words in a sentence - they allow a connection between previous information and current information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise looks at implementing a LSTM RNN to generate new characters after learning from a large sample of text. LSTMs are a special type of RNN which dramatically improves the modelâ€™s ability to connect previous data to current data where there is a long gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train an RNN model using a novel written by H. G. Wells - The Time Machine."
